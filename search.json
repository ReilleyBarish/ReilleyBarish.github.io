    "text": "Incoming freshman have been getting a lot of fame and play time in NCAA volleyball recently. From Harper Murray to Olivia Babcock to Chloe Chicoine; these talented players have made a name for themselves but are they better than the seniors that have had four years to get to this level of playing? Players like Kendall Kipp, Devyn Robinson, Asjia O’Neal and Jillian Gillen. These amazing women have helped paved the way for volleyball and how to play the game at an elite level.\nAnyone would guess that there is a huge difference between a freshman player and a senior player. One has had four years at this level to gain experience, practice, learn, etc. While a freshman has had no experience, less practice, not much time playing together as a team. I mean people transfer in early Spring, Nebraska does it all the time, but you can have a well oiled machine one year and the next feel off the rails.\nIt leads us back to the question, are freshman or seniors better at killing the ball?\nTo do that lets look at some numbers and data sets.\nThe data is Sports Data Files of the 2023 NCAA volleyball season courtesy of Professor Matt Waite.\nHere is the data: https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2023.\nNCAA combined all the player stats from the 2023 season into one place for us to access them. We are only going to focus on offense and specifically kill metrics.\nThis includes kills, sets played, total attacks, errors and hitting percentage.\nLet’s start off with a look at players kills and how it compares to the sets played. It is important to look at it by year, as that is the question we are trying to have answered.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv (\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2023.csv\")\n\nyear &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(yr = factor(yr, levels = c(\"Fr\", \"So\", \"Jr\", \"Sr\",\"NA\")))|&gt;\n  select(team, full_name, yr, pos, kills, errors, total_attacks, hit_pct, s) |&gt;\n  filter(pos %in% c(\"OH\", \"OPP\", \"RS\",\"MB\")) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(yr) == FALSE)\n           \n         \n           \n  \n\navgkills &lt;- data |&gt; summarise(mean(kills))\navgsets &lt;- data |&gt; summarise(mean(s))\n\ncustheme &lt;- \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\nfw &lt;- year |&gt;\n  filter(s &gt; 68)\n\n#| include: false\nggsave(\"main.png\")\n\n\nfreshman &lt;- year |&gt;\n  filter(\n    yr == \"Fr\"\n  )\nseniors &lt;- year |&gt;\n  filter(\n    yr== \"Sr\"\n  )\njuniors &lt;- year |&gt;\n  filter(\n    yr == \"Jr\"\n  )\nsophomore &lt;- year |&gt;\n  filter(\n    yr == \"So\"\n  )\n\navgkillsyr &lt;- year |&gt;\n  group_by(yr) |&gt;\n  filter(s &gt; 68) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    avgkillsyr = mean(kills, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\navgtotatt &lt;- year |&gt;\n  group_by(yr) |&gt;\n  filter(s &gt; 68) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    avgtoatt = mean(total_attacks, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\nfr &lt;- c(\"Average Kills\"=181, \"Average Attacks\"=513)\nsr &lt;- c(\"Average Kills\"=233, \"Average Attacks\"=616)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept=632, color=\"red\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(100,200,300,400,500,600,700), limits = c(0, 700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(80,100,120), limits = c(68, 131)) +\n  geom_line(data=fw, aes(x=s, y=kills, group=yr)) + \n  facet_grid(. ~ yr)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=86.94779, color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Sets Played\", \n    y=\"Total Kills\", \n    title=\"Seniors Have Proven Why They Deserve Play Time\", \n    subtitle=\"Seniors dominate the total kills category.The &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; line shows the max total kills by a player.

Each black line in the graph represents an individual player, and we see that seniors are consistently clustered in the 500–600 kills range while freshmen rarely reach those numbers, with only one managing to exceed 500 kills.\nFreshman also play less sets with only a few people going past 120 sets played. Seniors, on the other hand, have plenty of people playing more than 120 sets. Maybe this indicates that they are trusted with more playing time and have more chances to score.\nSo, is the higher kill count due to talent or time on the court?\n\n\nCode\nbc1 &lt;-ggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=year,\n    aes(x=s, y=kills, size=yr), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3)+\n  geom_point(\n    data = freshman,\n    aes(x = s, y = kills, size = yr),\n    color = \"red\"\n  ) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 68.59631) +\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 86.94779) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sets Played\",\n    y = \"Total Kills\",\n    title = \"Freshman Are Not to the Same Level as Seniors \",\n    subtitle = \"2023 was the year of the incoming freshman though many placed pressure onto the players to perform.\"\n  ) +\n  custheme\n\nbc2&lt;-ggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=year,\n    aes(x=s, y=kills, size=yr), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3)+\n  geom_point(\n    data = seniors,\n    aes(x = s, y = kills, size = yr),\n    color = \"blue\"\n  ) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 68.59631) +\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 86.94779) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sets Played\",\n    y = \"Total Kills\",\n    caption = \"Source: Matt Waite Github: 2023 NCAA Player Stats | By Reilley Barish\")+\n  custheme\n\nbc1 + bc2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first plot, we can see how freshmen (in the red) are scattered mostly below the average kill and set lines, with only a few pushing past the average number of sets played. While some freshmen are showing promise, the cluster of red dots stays below the average total kills line, showing that most are still adjusting to the level and pace of college volleyball.\nIn the second plot, the seniors (in the blue) tell a different story. We can see that the seniors consistently played more sets, but they also produced significantly more kills. The denser concentration of blue dots above both the average sets played and kills lines suggests that seniors are being leaders offensively.\nLets look at the sophomores versus the juniors for fun.\n\n\nCode\nbc3 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=year,\n    aes(x=s, y=kills, size=yr), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3)+\n  geom_point(\n    data = sophomore,\n    aes(x = s, y = kills, size = yr),\n    color = \"purple\"\n  ) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 68.59631) +\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 86.94779) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sets Played\",\n    y = \"Total Kills\",\n    title = \"The Battle of the Middle Grades\",\n    subtitle = \"How the two middle grades, sophomores and juniors, measure up to each other.\"\n  ) +\n  custheme\n\nbc4 &lt;-ggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=year,\n    aes(x=s, y=kills, size=yr), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3)+\n  geom_point(\n    data = juniors,\n    aes(x = s, y = kills, size = yr),\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 68.59631) +\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 86.94779) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sets Played\",\n    y = \"Total Kills\",\n    caption = \"Source: Matt Waite Github: 2023 NCAA Player Stats | By Reilley Barish\"\n  ) +\n  custheme\nbc3+bc4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, the two graphs appear fairly similar. They both are scattered across the range of sets played and both are around the average kill line. However, juniors (in the dark green) show a slight edge to the sophomores (in the pink). The juniors have a bit more players crossing above the average kill line and sets played.\nThis helps supports the idea of experience and increased opportunities as players progress through their college careers. When compared to the freshman graph, we can see a natural progression. As players gain experience and trust from coaching staff, their playing time increases, and with it, their kills and sets played.\n\n\nCode\nfr5 &lt;- c(\"Average Kills\"=181, \"Average Attacks\"=513, 155)\nsr5 &lt;- c(\"Average Kills\"=233, \"Average Attacks\"=616)\n\niron(\n waffle(fr5/5, \n        rows = 10, \n        xlab=\"1 square = 5 kills\", \n        colors = c(\"red\", \"black\", \"white\")\n        )+\n   labs(\n     x=\"Freshman\",\n     title=\"Seniors Tend to Need More Attacks to Kill a Ball\", \n     subtitle=\"Freshman's pure power and youthful energy makes it easier to put balls down.\",\n     )  +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n waffle(sr5/5, \n        rows = 10, \n        xlab=\"1 square = 5 kills\", \n        colors = c(\"blue\", \"black\")\n        )+\n   labs(\n     x = \"Senior\\n1 Square = 5 Kills or Attacks\",\n     caption=\"Source: 2023 NCAA Volleyball Player Stats | Graphic by Reilley Barish\"\n     ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile seniors have been better in total kills and sets played, freshmen stand out in efficiency to kill the ball. As shown it takes seniors more attack attempts to produce kills compared to freshmen. This suggests that while seniors take on more offensive volume, freshmen are converting their chances at a higher rate.\nThis is very interesting. Freshmen averaged 181 kills on 513 attempts, while seniors had 233 kills on 616 attempts. This shows that freshman either have better shot selection, stronger offensive support or simply talent and power. It’s also worth noting though that seniors often face the opponent’s best blockers, take more high-pressure swings and play longer throughout the season.\nThe data shows that seniors consistently outperform other grades in terms of total kills and sets played. But seniors often have the most experience, more playing time and leadership roles on their respective teams. They have earned their place and play time, and it shows on the stat sheet.\nHowever, freshmen are quickly and quietly rewriting this narrative. While freshman do not play as many as seniors or have as many total kills, their kill-to-attack ratio is stronger. This means they are more efficient when they do get the chance to play. That efficiency suggests raw talent and offensive potential.\nSo, are freshmen better at killing the ball than seniors? Yes, if we are talking about efficiency. But if we are talking overall impact, consistency and volume, seniors still lead the way."
