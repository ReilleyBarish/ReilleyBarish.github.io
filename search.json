Highlighted in red, Rodriguez stands out not only for her impressive total but for setting a new benchmark in back-row performance.\nRodriguez’s consistency and impact on the court is undeniable, with each season contributing to a legacy built on quick reflexes, smart positioning, and unmatched defensive instincts.\nBut to truly appreciate the arc of her performance over time, we need to see how she has improved or declined throughout her time at Nebraska.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=ds, aes(x=season, y=digs, group=name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=ds, aes(x=season, y=digs, group=name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_line(data=lr, aes(x=season, y=digs, group=name), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=lr, aes(x=season, y=digs, group=name), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_text(data = lr |&gt; filter(season == min(season)), aes(x = season - .2, y=digs, label = name), size = 3, hjust = 0.75) +\n  geom_text(data = lr |&gt; filter(season == max(season)), aes(x = season + .2, y=digs, label = name), size = 3, hjust = 0.2) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=265.55, color=\"black\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2021, 2022, 2023, 2024), limits = c(2020.5, 2024.5)) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=2020.63, y=240, label=\"Average Total Digs\"), size=3)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Total Digs\", \n    title=\"Lexi Rodriguez: Digging, Diving, and Defying Gravity\", \n    subtitle=\"A season-by-season look at Nebraska’s all-time digs leader from 2021 to 2024\" ,\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA Volleyball | By Reilley Barish\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  custheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRodriguez’s dig totals tell a story of her consistent excellence. She started her college career in 2021 with an impressive 440 digs, immediately establishing herself as a defensive force. After 2021, opponent offensives started to ignore her and target others during serves because Rodriguez was just that good.\nIn 2022, she followed up with 415, demonstrating not just talent but consistency under pressure. Her junior year saw a slight dip to 398 which was still well above the NCAA average of 265 digs per season. She the finished out her senior year with a bounce-back performance, recording 435 digs.\nOver four seasons, Rodriguez never fell below the 390-mark, a testament to her durability, skill, and central role in Nebraska’s defensive system. Her line on the slope chart doesn’t just rise and fall: it stays way above the average, proving her elite status among collegiate liberos.\nRodriguez was often compared and challenged against Louisville’s libero, Elena Scott. Elena Scott was the heartbeat of Louisville’s back court, anchoring the defense with sharp instincts and relentless hustle. As the Cardinals’ standout libero, she’s consistently among the nation’s leaders in digs, earning a reputation as one of the top defensive players in the NCAA.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=ds, aes(x=season, y=digs, group=name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=ds, aes(x=season, y=digs, group=name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_line(data=lr, aes(x=season, y=digs, group=name), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=lr, aes(x=season, y=digs, group=name), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_line(data=es, aes(x=season, y=digs, group=name), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=es, aes(x=season, y=digs, group=name), color=\"blue\")+\n  geom_text(data = lr |&gt; filter(season == min(season)), aes(x = season - .2, y=digs, label = name), size = 3, hjust = 0.75) +\n  geom_text(data = lr |&gt; filter(season == max(season)), aes(x = season + .2, y=digs, label = name), size = 3, hjust = 0.2) +\n  geom_text(data = es |&gt; filter(season == min(season)), aes(x = season - .2, y=digs, label = name), size = 3, hjust = 0.75) +\n  geom_text(data = es |&gt; filter(season == max(season)), aes(x = season + .2, y=digs, label = name), size = 3, hjust = 0.2) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=265.55, color=\"black\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2021, 2022, 2023, 2024), limits = c(2020.5, 2024.5)) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=2020.63, y=240, label=\"Average Total Digs\"), size=3)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Total Digs\", \n    title=\"Digging It Out: Lexi Rodriguez vs. Elena Scott\", \n    subtitle=\"A deep dive into the careers of two of NCAA’s greatest back-row players\" ,\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA Volleyball | By Reilley Barish\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  custheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing and contrasting Lexi Rodriguez and Elena Scott side by side, the numbers show a tight and compelling race throughout their four-year careers.\nIn 2021, Lexi tallied 440 digs, slightly ahead of Elena’s 415, giving Rodriguez the early edge. But in 2022, Scott surged ahead with 467 digs, outpacing Rodriguez’s 398 that year. The 2023 season Elena posted 523 digs, dominating and being the overall digs leader that season. However, Rodriguez answered back in 2024 with a standout 435 digs, though still trailing Scott’s career-high 554 that season.\nOverall, Elena Scott’s rise as a back-row dominator and Lexi Rodriguez’s consistent performance over four years highlight their impressive careers. Their high rankings in single-season totals and their ability to consistently perform above the NCAA average are a testament to their elite status in defense. It’s interesting to see how both players made their mark in different ways with Scott’s rapid improvement each season and Rodriguez’s steadiness across her career.\nThey are both incredible leaders on and off the court but it takes more than just digs to be a good libero.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=dsP5, aes(x=aces, y=s_err), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=lr21, aes(x=aces, y=s_err), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=lr21, aes(x=aces, y=s_err, label=\"2021\")) +\n  geom_point(data=lr22, aes(x=aces, y=s_err), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=lr22, aes(x=aces, y=s_err, label=\"2022\")) +\n  geom_point(data=lr23, aes(x=aces, y=s_err), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=lr23, aes(x=aces, y=s_err, label=\"2023\")) +\n  geom_point(data=lr24, aes(x=aces, y=s_err), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=lr24, aes(x=aces, y=s_err, label=\"2024\")) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.1, \n        xmin = 18.74333, xmax = Inf,\n        ymin = 0, ymax = 26.94333) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=35, y=10, label=\"Good Player Zone\"), size=3)+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Service Aces\", \n    y=\"Service Errors\", \n    title=\"Serving Up Success: Aces to Service Errors Ratio\", \n    subtitle=\"Tracking the effectiveness of Rodriguez’s serve, from aces to service errors\" ,\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA Volleyball | By Reilley Barish\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  custheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in the graph reveals a detailed picture of Lexi Rodriguez’s serving performance over the years, showing both her strengths and areas for improvement.\nIn 2021, 2022, and 2023, Rodriguez’s service errors were above the NCAA average, which indicates that while her serving was effective, it came with a higher risk of errors.\nSpecifically, in 2022, she recorded her highest number of service errors, but this was also the year where she registered the most service aces, suggesting that she was taking more risks with her serves in an effort to generate points.\nHowever, in 2024, Rodriguez’s service errors dropped below the average, marking a significant improvement in her consistency.\nBeing a libero means having a good serve and being a well-rounded player wherever the team needs you. Rodriguez was consistent with her serve but she was not the best server out of all the liberos, constantly falling behind the average service errors and aces. While Rodriguez may not have been good in one area, she excelled in another.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=playersds, aes(x=reorder(name, totassists), weight=totassists), fill=\"grey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=lr, aes(x=reorder(name, assists), weight=assists), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Players Name\", \n    y=\"Total Assists\", \n    title=\"Out of System, But Never Out of Options\", \n    subtitle=\"Lexi Rodriguez turns every broken play into a perfect opportunity\" ,\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA Volleyball | By Reilley Barish\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  custheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRodriguez is known as the out-of-system queen for a reason. Her assists stand out due to her consistency and ability to contribute significantly even in difficult, out-of-system situations. Her position on the chart demonstrates her importance in converting broken plays into scoring opportunities, a testament to her skill and vision on the court.\nDespite being part of a highly competitive group, Rodriguez’s assists shows that she was a key player in creating successful plays, turning lost opportunities into meaningful contributions for her team. The chart underscores her role as a reliable setter who can maintain composure and precision, even when the team is out of system.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=dsP5, aes(x=s, y=digs), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=lr21, aes(x=s, y=digs), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=lr21, aes(x=s, y=digs, label=\"2021\")) +\n  geom_point(data=lr22, aes(x=s, y=digs), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=lr22, aes(x=s, y=digs, label=\"2022\")) +\n  geom_point(data=lr23, aes(x=s, y=digs), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=lr23, aes(x=s, y=digs, label=\"2023\")) +\n  geom_point(data=lr24, aes(x=s, y=digs), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=lr24, aes(x=s, y=digs, label=\"2024\")) +\n  geom_point(data=lc24, aes(x=s, y=digs), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=lc23, aes(x=s, y=digs), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=om, aes(x=s, y=digs), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=mb, aes(x=s, y=digs), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=ka, aes(x=s, y=digs), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=kk, aes(x=s, y=digs), color=\"blue\") +\n\n  annotate(\"rect\", fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.1, \n        xmin = 65, xmax = Inf,\n        ymin = 265, ymax = Inf) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=80, y=465, label=\"Good Player Zone\"), size=3)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Sets Played\", \n    y=\"Total Digs\", \n    title=\"An Extra Visual: Lexi Rodriguez’s Total Dominance\", \n    subtitle=\"Because one chart wasn’t enough to capture her back-row brilliance\" ,\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA Volleyball | By Reilley Barish\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  custheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the scatterplot above, we can see how Lexi was totally dominate, especially among her libero and defensive specialist peers.\nOverall, Lexi Rodriguez is the best of the best. She had lead a team both on and off the court for four years, serving as a captain for two. She has set the standard of what a libero should look and play like. Lexi Rodriguez is now a household name for anyone in the volleyball sport and she has set a legacy and name for herself. Sitting at the top of Nebraska’s all-time career digs leader, her name is forever known as one of the greats.\nRodriguez is continuing her volleyball career in the pro volleyball world. She is apart of the LOVB Omaha team, with other huskers like Jordan Larson and Justine Wong-Orantes. She just finished up her rookie season finishing as the LOVB championhsip runner-ups. We can’t wait to see what else she gets to do now out of college."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Incoming freshman have been getting a lot of fame and play time in NCAA volleyball recently. From Harper Murray to Olivia Babcock to Chloe Chicoine; these talented players have made a name for themselves but are they better than the seniors that have had four years to get to this level of playing? Players like Kendall Kipp, Devyn Robinson, Asjia O’Neal and Jillian Gillen. These amazing women have helped paved the way for volleyball and how to play the game at an elite level.\nAnyone would guess that there is a huge difference between a freshman player and a senior player. One has had four years at this level to gain experience, practice, learn, etc. While a freshman has had no experience, less practice, not much time playing together as a team. I mean people transfer in early Spring, Nebraska does it all the time, but you can have a well oiled machine one year and the next feel off the rails.\nIt leads us back to the question, are freshman or seniors better at killing the ball?\nTo do that lets look at some numbers and data sets.\nThe data is Sports Data Files of the 2023 NCAA volleyball season courtesy of Professor Matt Waite.\nHere is the data: https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2023.\nNCAA combined all the player stats from the 2023 season into one place for us to access them. We are only going to focus on offense and specifically kill metrics.\nThis includes kills, sets played, total attacks, errors and hitting percentage.\nLet’s start off with a look at players kills and how it compares to the sets played. It is important to look at it by year, as that is the question we are trying to have answered.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv (\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2023.csv\")\n\nyear &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(yr = factor(yr, levels = c(\"Fr\", \"So\", \"Jr\", \"Sr\",\"NA\")))|&gt;\n  select(team, full_name, yr, pos, kills, errors, total_attacks, hit_pct, s) |&gt;\n  filter(pos %in% c(\"OH\", \"OPP\", \"RS\",\"MB\")) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(yr) == FALSE)\n           \n         \n           \n  \n\navgkills &lt;- data |&gt; summarise(mean(kills))\navgsets &lt;- data |&gt; summarise(mean(s))\n\ncustheme &lt;- \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\nfw &lt;- year |&gt;\n  filter(s &gt; 68)\n\n#| include: false\nggsave(\"main.png\")\n\n\nfreshman &lt;- year |&gt;\n  filter(\n    yr == \"Fr\"\n  )\nseniors &lt;- year |&gt;\n  filter(\n    yr== \"Sr\"\n  )\njuniors &lt;- year |&gt;\n  filter(\n    yr == \"Jr\"\n  )\nsophomore &lt;- year |&gt;\n  filter(\n    yr == \"So\"\n  )\n\navgkillsyr &lt;- year |&gt;\n  group_by(yr) |&gt;\n  filter(s &gt; 68) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    avgkillsyr = mean(kills, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\navgtotatt &lt;- year |&gt;\n  group_by(yr) |&gt;\n  filter(s &gt; 68) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    avgtoatt = mean(total_attacks, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\nfr &lt;- c(\"Average Kills\"=181, \"Average Attacks\"=513)\nsr &lt;- c(\"Average Kills\"=233, \"Average Attacks\"=616)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept=632, color=\"red\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(100,200,300,400,500,600,700), limits = c(0, 700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(80,100,120), limits = c(68, 131)) +\n  geom_line(data=fw, aes(x=s, y=kills, group=yr)) + \n  facet_grid(. ~ yr)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=86.94779, color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Sets Played\", \n    y=\"Total Kills\", \n    title=\"Seniors Have Proven Why They Deserve Play Time\", \n    subtitle=\"Seniors dominate the total kills category.The &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; line shows the max total kills by a player.

Each black line in the graph represents an individual player, and we see that seniors are consistently clustered in the 500–600 kills range while freshmen rarely reach those numbers, with only one managing to exceed 500 kills.\nFreshman also play less sets with only a few people going past 120 sets played. Seniors, on the other hand, have plenty of people playing more than 120 sets. Maybe this indicates that they are trusted with more playing time and have more chances to score.\nSo, is the higher kill count due to talent or time on the court?\n\n\nCode\nbc1 &lt;-ggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=year,\n    aes(x=s, y=kills, size=yr), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3)+\n  geom_point(\n    data = freshman,\n    aes(x = s, y = kills, size = yr),\n    color = \"red\"\n  ) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 68.59631) +\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 86.94779) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sets Played\",\n    y = \"Total Kills\",\n    title = \"Freshman Are Not to the Same Level as Seniors \",\n    subtitle = \"2023 was the year of the incoming freshman though many placed pressure onto the players to perform.\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  custheme\n\nbc2&lt;-ggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=year,\n    aes(x=s, y=kills, size=yr), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3)+\n  geom_point(\n    data = seniors,\n    aes(x = s, y = kills, size = yr),\n    color = \"blue\"\n  ) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 68.59631) +\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 86.94779) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sets Played\",\n    y = \"Total Kills\",\n    caption = \"Source: Matt Waite Github: 2023 NCAA Player Stats | By Reilley Barish\")+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  custheme\n\nbc1 + bc2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first plot, we can see how freshmen (in the red) are scattered mostly below the average kill and set lines, with only a few pushing past the average number of sets played. While some freshmen are showing promise, the cluster of red dots stays below the average total kills line, showing that most are still adjusting to the level and pace of college volleyball.\nIn the second plot, the seniors (in the blue) tell a different story. We can see that the seniors consistently played more sets, but they also produced significantly more kills. The denser concentration of blue dots above both the average sets played and kills lines suggests that seniors are being leaders offensively.\nLets look at the sophomores versus the juniors for fun.\n\n\nCode\nbc3 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=year,\n    aes(x=s, y=kills, size=yr), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3)+\n  geom_point(\n    data = sophomore,\n    aes(x = s, y = kills, size = yr),\n    color = \"purple\"\n  ) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 68.59631) +\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 86.94779) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sets Played\",\n    y = \"Total Kills\",\n    title = \"The Battle of the Middle Grades\",\n    subtitle = \"How the two middle grades, sophomores and juniors, measure up to each other.\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  custheme\n\nbc4 &lt;-ggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=year,\n    aes(x=s, y=kills, size=yr), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3)+\n  geom_point(\n    data = juniors,\n    aes(x = s, y = kills, size = yr),\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 68.59631) +\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 86.94779) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sets Played\",\n    y = \"Total Kills\",\n    caption = \"Source: Matt Waite Github: 2023 NCAA Player Stats | By Reilley Barish\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  custheme\nbc3+bc4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, the two graphs appear fairly similar. They both are scattered across the range of sets played and both are around the average kill line. However, juniors (in the dark green) show a slight edge to the sophomores (in the pink). The juniors have a bit more players crossing above the average kill line and sets played.\nThis helps supports the idea of experience and increased opportunities as players progress through their college careers. When compared to the freshman graph, we can see a natural progression. As players gain experience and trust from coaching staff, their playing time increases, and with it, their kills and sets played.\n\n\nCode\nfr5 &lt;- c(\"Average Kills\"=181, \"Average Attacks\"=513, 155)\nsr5 &lt;- c(\"Average Kills\"=233, \"Average Attacks\"=616)\n\niron(\n waffle(fr5/5, \n        rows = 10, \n        xlab=\"1 square = 5 kills\", \n        colors = c(\"red\", \"black\", \"white\")\n        )+\n   labs(\n     x=\"Freshman\",\n     title=\"Seniors Tend to Need More Attacks to Kill a Ball\", \n     subtitle=\"Freshman's pure power and youthful energy makes it easier to put balls down.\",\n     )  +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n waffle(sr5/5, \n        rows = 10, \n        xlab=\"1 square = 5 kills\", \n        colors = c(\"blue\", \"black\")\n        )+\n   labs(\n     x = \"Senior\\n1 Square = 5 Kills or Attacks\",\n     caption=\"Source: 2023 NCAA Volleyball Player Stats | Graphic by Reilley Barish\"\n     ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile seniors have been better in total kills and sets played, freshmen stand out in efficiency to kill the ball. As shown it takes seniors more attack attempts to produce kills compared to freshmen. This suggests that while seniors take on more offensive volume, freshmen are converting their chances at a higher rate.\nThis is very interesting. Freshmen averaged 181 kills on 513 attempts, while seniors had 233 kills on 616 attempts. This shows that freshman either have better shot selection, stronger offensive support or simply talent and power. It’s also worth noting though that seniors often face the opponent’s best blockers, take more high-pressure swings and play longer throughout the season.\nThe data shows that seniors consistently outperform other grades in terms of total kills and sets played. But seniors often have the most experience, more playing time and leadership roles on their respective teams. They have earned their place and play time, and it shows on the stat sheet.\nHowever, freshmen are quickly and quietly rewriting this narrative. While freshman do not play as many as seniors or have as many total kills, their kill-to-attack ratio is stronger. This means they are more efficient when they do get the chance to play. That efficiency suggests raw talent and offensive potential.\nSo, are freshmen better at killing the ball than seniors? Yes, if we are talking about efficiency. But if we are talking overall impact, consistency and volume, seniors still lead the way."
